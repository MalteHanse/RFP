    "In our previous endeavours we experienced that performing an accurate simulation of particle transport is not trivial. There are several softwares developed to solve this task, and for someone who is more interested in performing the analysis of a reactor core, it is often better to use an already verified and validated code instead of developing a new one from scratch. There are several such codes solving neutron transport either relying on deterministic or stochastic methods. During this datalab we will use a rather young code called OpenMC, which was originally developed at MIT.  \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMC is a Monte Carlo neutron and photon transport simulation code. It can be used both for fixed source and for criticality calculations. The user can define complicated geometries with constructive solid geometries. OpenMC is written in C++, however it has a rich Python API, which will allow us to comminicate with the code through jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMC is not yet an industrial standard code, however our motivation to use it for this course was that it is \n",
    "\n",
    "1. freely available\n",
    "2. the important physics we could not tackle within this course ourselves (eg. thermal scattering and several reactions) are implemented in it\n",
    "3. since we can interact with the code through Python, we can deepen our programming skills\n",
    "4. for small problems it runs relatively fast on a single PC\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, today we are going to walk through a simple openMC input file. During this course we will only work with pincell models (ie. a single fuel pin infinite in the axial length with reflective boundaries, so neutrons are reflected back from the boundary in this way approximating an infinite core). This is of course a simplification of a complete reactor core, but it will still allow us to see a lot of cool physics. One could of course perform simulations at the assembly level or for a full-core, however such simulations would be more time consuming. There are several further examples at https://docs.openmc.org/.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that this notebook should be opened from an environment where openmc is available!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The input file\n",
    "\n",
    "During the datalab we will define the following problem which roughly matches a typical western-type pressurized water reactor's conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- PWR pincell with reflective boundaries\n",
    "- Fuel radius: 0.41 cm\n",
    "- Fuel material: enriched UO2 with density 10.5 g/cm3\n",
    "- Cladding inner/outer radius: 0.42/0.45 cm\n",
    "- Cladding material: zirconium  with density 6.6 g/cm3\n",
    "- Coolant/moderator: pressurized water with density 0.75 g/cm3\n",
    "- Cell pitch: 1.26 cm\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in practice, PWR fuel cladding is made of an alloy called Zircaloy, nevertheless it has little influence on the neutron economy, therefore we will approximate it as pure zirconium with its natural abundance of isotopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do we need in order to define an openMC input?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Materials: which materials are included in our geometry (nuclide content, temperature, density)?\n",
    "2. Geometry: how does the geometry look like? \n",
    "3. Tally: what are the quantities of interest? For example flux, or fission rate?\n",
    "4. Settings: how many neutrons we would like to include in the calculation?\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these steps we will use the python API to export an xml file, which the code will use once we execute it. Note however that one could directly write xml files without using python, and run the code outside of Jupyter. For larger problems this is sometimes better. However we will want to analyse the output results in python, and sometimes we will script the input, so for us it is handy to use the python API.\n",

    "Do you remember the example `Material()` class we developed before? That is pretty similar to the `Material()` class of openMC. We create an instance of `Material()`, with a numeric id of the material, and then we can add nuclides, and set the density. We can also set the temperature (which can be 294 K, 600 K, 900 K, 1200 K, 2500 K, the temperatures at which the available cross sections are evaluated). There are other options as well (for example one can directly set the enrichment), what you can find in the documentation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our geometry is infinite in the axial dimension. First we define three cylinders (the bounding surfaces of the fuel, and the cladding). Then we use constuctive solid geometry rules to define the regions between the surfaces, and create the fuel pin. Finally we will define the water region around the fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then need to define a `Universe()` (the usefulness of this is not apparent in our simple exercise, but when defining reactor cores with repetitive patterns of various types of fuel assemblies, then \"universes\" are the way to handle this in most neutron transport code. You do not need to worry about this in this course). And finally we create a `Geometry()`, and link the universe. We will then export the information into an xml file. \n",

    "1. *filters*: which part of the phase space we would like score at (for example only a certain part of the geometry is of interest, or certain energy bins)?\n",

    "There are several ways of plotting the geometry. The simplest inline plotting option is to call the `plot()` method of the `Universe()` object (in our case this was called `root`). This is a wrapper of matplotlib. However, there is a more advanced options by setting up an instance of the `Plot()` class, and running openMC directly to generate a plot. Since in this course we work with a rather simple geometry, we will not look at the advanced plotting option, but you are welcome to check the user's guide."

    "Finally, we are done, and nothing left just to run openMC and wait for the results. For this we have to specify where the cross section files are (this we could do in the system as well). Then call the `openmc.run()` method. And you immediately see how the k-effective is being estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1**: The results are being stored in a file named 'statepoint.100.h5' (100 refers to the number of batches), also a 'summary.h5' and some other files are created. Sometimes openMC is complaining if there are already existing h5 files, so in this case we can remove (`rm`) these files. For this we make a system call with `os.system` to remove any file for which the name starts with 's' and ands with 'h5'. Nevertheless, be careful with removing files, not to loose data. \n",
